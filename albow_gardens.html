                Located in the northern suburbs of Cape Town, Albow Gardens is a block of council housing encircled by a nearly two-metre-high iron fence dividing the community within it from the neighborhood surrounding it.
                During Apartheid, these pastel-coloured buildings, with big black letters painted on them were used as dormitories by Air Force soldiers at Ysterplaat military base, which borders the eastern perimeter of the district. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I ended up in Albow Gardens by accident, looking for a story to tell, something to photograph, something to believe in.
                I let myself be attracted by those buildings so foreign to me. 
                I first got in thanks to Natty. While sweeping leaves from the pathway, intrigued, she called me to her. 
                At the time Albow Gardens could have been everything I was looking for or nothing at all, but I didn’t know yet. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In Albow Gardens I also met Cecil, Bianca, and their children. I was wandering through the buildings, when I saw Cecil looking at me from the third-floor landing of block G. 
                From where I was standing he looked like a giant, I remember thinking, but we smiled at each other. 
                Meeting Cecil and his family was one of those special encounters that life sometimes throws at you and that turns everything upside down, one of those encounters that changes the way you feel and see things.

                Meeting Cecil and his family was one of those special encounters that life sometimes throws at  you and that turns everything upside down, one of those encounters that changes the way you  feel and see things. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I spent almost three years inside Albow Gardens. When I was there nothing else mattered, time  flowed at its own speed.  
                <br>
                <br>
                I never felt that sense of enoughness, of warmth and connection, like I felt when I was in Albow Gardens. I have never felt that trust before.
                Only later I realized that that was all I had always been looking for.
                <br>
                <br>
                Albow Gardens is a place made of things and people like any others, but a place where everything felt closer to me, a place where everything felt more real.
                In Albow Gardens I could always be myself, without having to be anyone else, without having to hold anyone together. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Within this community, I met so many people that welcomed and trusted me and my intentions, when my intentions were still unclear. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I thank them, one by one, for understanding and trusting me without really knowing who I was, and why I was there.
                I especially thank Cecil and Bianca and their amazing children for teaching me a different way of looking at things.
                <br>
                This is going to last forever.
