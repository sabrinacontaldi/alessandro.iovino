    <!-- <p>I must have been 4 or 5, we were living all together, under the same roof - my mum and my dad, my brother

    <p>Since then, I've always had the feeling that my family lied to me, mostly for a little courage.</p>
    <p>I lived most of my life with one person, my mother.</p>
    <p>Most of who I am today is because of her and because of her, I had to run away.</p>
    <p>The people I've surrounded me with helped me to understand what kind of truth I needed; photography helped me to keep track of it.</p>
    <p>Today what makes me happy is knowing t that whatever I do, is done with certain honesty.</p> 
    <p>Today I feel I'm in a much better place than I was, I feel I don't have to run anymore.</p>
